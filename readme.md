## 📝 Helios Pro / Vallox SE ventilation control (for older RS485 models)

👉 This is a Fork from original Tom-Bom-badils code so all respect belongs to him<br/>
I've modified the original code with help of AI as I'm no .py coder.<br/>
Before installation you must have both ventilation equipments connected with RS586 to LAN/WiFi.<br/>
I've used Waveshare RS485 to LAN-WiFi converters, other with LAN and the other with WiFi. No problems.<br/>
<br/>
Installation to HA is manual:<br/>
- Create folder 'Custom_components' and under that 'helios_vallox_ventilation'<br/>
- Copy all files to 'helios_vallox_ventilation'<br/>
- Restart HA<br/>
- Go to Settings > Devices & services > Integrations<br/>
- Find 'Helios Pro/Vallox SE Ventilation' open and 'Add entry' for both equipments<br/>
- There will be two of them _YK & _AK = Yläkerta ja Alakerta = Upstairs and Downstairs<br/>
<br/>

Only tested with Vallox Digit SE<br/>
